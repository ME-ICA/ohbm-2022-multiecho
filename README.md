## Open Science Room Session: Discussion of priorities for multi-echo fMRI methods development

* Emergent Session: Wednesday, June 22th, 10:30-11:30 GMT+1
* [Full Schedule for Open Science Room](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2022/schedule/)
* [Direct Link to session](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/osr-2022--emergent-8)
* [Agenda and Notes from the Session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1myZ23SiGHlwLmtjRQo97e6Za-3DtirrcwVEWAHliaIM/edit?usp=sharing)

Multi-echo fMRI is an acquisition method that can be used to empirically identify and remove non-neural noise. There is active research into ways we can use multi-echo information to improve our data. Over the past 5 years, much of this work has been done in open and collaborative framework. tedana.readthedocs.io is both multi-echo denoising software and a hub for educational and support resources for people interested in multi-echo fMRI. The developers of tedana created a roadmap for the main goals of our work and we're getting near (definitely not there) to accomplishing those goals. We want to use this session to both provide a status report regarding tedana and to open discussion for priorities for multi-echo fMRI development either within or outside of tedana.
